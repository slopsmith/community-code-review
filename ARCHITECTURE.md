# Community Code Review — Architecture

## Overview

The system has three components:

1. **Coordinator** (Python FastAPI on the leader's machine) — Exposes a single OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, load-balances across volunteers via WebSocket tunnels.
2. **Volunteer Agent** (Python + `llama-server` on community machines) — Auto-downloads the model, starts `llama-server`, opens a **persistent outbound WebSocket** connection to the coordinator, and waits for work.
3. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (per-repo) — Triggers `ocr review` on PRs, running on the organization's self-hosted runner.

### Design Principles

- **Zero-friction for volunteers** — set three env vars, run one command, you're done
- **Gamer-friendly** — volunteers automatically step aside when their GPU is busy; no manual toggles needed
- **Defense in depth** — volunteers make only outbound connections; GPU and model volume are the only host resources shared
- **Truly no inbound** — the coordinator never connects to volunteers; volunteers connect outbound and stay connected
- **Sensible defaults, optional overrides** — everything has a default; only customization is opt-in

```

The critical insight: **volunteers open the WebSocket outbound** and keep it open.
The coordinator never initiates a TCP connection to the volunteer — it sends work
through the already-established WebSocket tunnel.

## Volunteer Lifecycle & GPU Awareness

Volunteers move through five states, tracked by the coordinator:

| State | Description | Accepts work? |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `unloaded` | Connected, no model in VRAM | ✅ Yes (will load on demand) |
| `loading` | Currently loading model into VRAM | ❌ No |
| `ready` | Model loaded, GPU idle | ✅ Yes (preferred) |
| `busy` | Model loaded, actively inferencing | ✅ Yes, if parallel slots available |
| `unloading` | Freeing VRAM (stopping llama-server) | ❌ No |

### GPU Utilization Monitoring (Automatic)

The volunteer agent polls GPU utilization every 5 seconds and reports it to the coordinator:

```json
{"type": "gpu_status", "utilization_percent": 12, "memory_used_percent": 45}
```

If the volunteer's GPU is busy with other work (gaming, rendering, etc.), the volunteer **unloads the model from VRAM** and notifies the coordinator. The coordinator stops sending new assignments, and the volunteer's GPU is completely free for other tasks. When the GPU quiets down, the volunteer remains in the `unloaded` state — connected and ready to reload on the next request.

**Thresholds** (configurable via environment variables on the coordinator):
- `GPU_UTIL_THRESHOLD` — default 70%
- `GPU_MEM_THRESHOLD` — default 85%

A volunteer exceeding either threshold transitions to `busy` (if actively inferencing, will finish first) then `unloaded` (stops llama-server).

### Model Lifecycle (Real VRAM Management)

In v3+, the agent manages llama-server as a child subprocess rather than relying on the entrypoint:

| State | VRAM | llama-server | Accepts work? |
|-------|------|--------------|---------------|
| `unloaded` | Free | Stopped | ✅ Yes (will load on demand) |
| `loading` | Loading | Starting | ❌ No |
| `ready` | Loaded | Running, idle | ✅ Yes (preferred) |
| `busy` | Loaded | Running, processing | ✅ Yes, if parallel slots available |
| `unloading` | Freeing | Stopping | ❌ No |

**State transitions:**

```
unloaded ──(inference arrives)──▶ loading ──(llama-srv up)──▶ ready ──(handle & busy)──▶ busy
ready    ──(inference arrives)────────────────────────────────────────────────▶ busy
busy     ──(last request done)─────▶ ready (still loaded, idle)
busy     ──(GPU busy + done)───────▶ unloading ──(llama-srv down)▶ unloaded
ready    ──(GPU busy)──────────────▶ unloading ──(llama-srv down)▶ unloaded
ready    ──(idle timeout 120s)─────▶ unloading ──(llama-srv down)▶ unloaded
```

Note: `busy` means "at least one request in flight" — not "at capacity." The coordinator tracks `active_requests < max_parallel` before considering a volunteer saturated. llama-server handles concurrent requests via its `-np` flag (see below).

### Parallel Processing

llama-server supports multiple in-flight inference requests via the `-np` flag (default: 1). The coordinator respects this:

- `max_parallel` is reported by the volunteer during initialization
- The coordinator skips a volunteer when `active_requests >= max_parallel`
- Each inference request runs in its own `asyncio.create_task` on the volunteer
- llama-server batches concurrent prompt evaluations for GPU efficiency

**Auto-tuning** (`entrypoint.sh`): If the volunteer doesn't explicitly set `LLAMA_N_PARALLEL`, the entrypoint auto-calculates it:

```
parallel_slots = floor((total_vram_mib - model_size_mib - 1024) / 2560)
```

Where 2560 MiB is the estimated KV cache overhead per 32K-context slot. The result is clamped to 1–8. Users can override by setting `LLAMA_N_PARALLEL` explicitly in the `docker run` environment.

**Key behaviors:**
- **Load on demand**: llama-server starts only when the first inference request after idle/unload arrives. The requester waits for the model to load (30-60s).
- **Unload on GPU contention**: If another workload grabs the GPU (utilization > threshold), llama-server is SIGTERMed and VRAM is freed.
- **Idle timeout**: After 120 seconds (configurable via `IDLE_TIMEOUT`) with no requests, the model is unloaded to save power and keep GPU idle states available.
- **Mock mode**: In test/CI (`MOCK_MODE=1`), the entrypoint starts a lightweight Python HTTP stub instead of llama-server; the agent skips subprocess management and only probes the health endpoint.
- **Power savings**: When a model is loaded in VRAM, the GPU cannot enter its deepest idle power states. Unloading during idle periods reduces power draw, heat, and energy consumption — important for a project with climate-conscious goals.

### Scheduling Priority

The coordinator assigns work in this order:

1. **`ready` volunteers** with lowest `active_requests / max_parallel` ratio
2. **`busy` volunteers** with remaining capacity (`active_requests < max_parallel`)
3. **`unloaded` volunteers** — they'll load on demand (adds 30–60s latency for model load)
   - The coordinator should prefer ready volunteers when possible.
   - Once assigned, the volunteer's agent starts llama-server and waits for it to become healthy.
4. **Never pick `loading` or `unloading`** — they'd just queue behind their own state transition.

### Capacity Check

Before assigning work, the coordinator also checks that `active_requests < max_parallel` for the volunteer. A `ready` volunteer with `active_requests == max_parallel` is treated as full — the coordinator moves on to the next candidate. `busy` volunteers with remaining slots are preferred over `unloaded` ones to avoid model-load latency.

This minimizes time-to-review while respecting volunteer GPU availability.

## Connections

| Direction | Protocol | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Volunteer → Coordinator | **WebSocket** (outbound) | Persistent tunnel: registration (`init`), heartbeat, **receiving work**, GPU status |
| Self-hosted runner → Coordinator | HTTP (outbound) | `ocr review` API calls |
| Volunteer → Hugging Face / URL | HTTPS (outbound) | Model download (if not cached) |

Every single connection is **initiated outbound** by the volunteer or the runner.
No inbound firewall holes needed anywhere — works behind NAT, CGNAT, or strict corporate firewalls.

## API Contracts

### Coordinator ↔ Volunteer (WebSocket tunnel)

Volunteers connect to `ws://<coordinator>:8080/ws/<volunteer_id>` and keep the
connection open. The coordinator sends work requests as JSON messages over this
WebSocket, and the volunteer sends responses back over the same connection.

**Message from coordinator → volunteer (inference request):**
```json
{
  "type": "inference",
  "id": "req-uuid",
  "body": { "model": "...", "messages": [...], "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.7, "stream": false }
}
```

**Message from volunteer → coordinator (inference response):**
```json
{
  "type": "inference_result",
  "id": "req-uuid",
  "status": "success",
  "body": { "id": "...", "object": "chat.completion", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}] }
}
```

On error:
```json
{ "type": "inference_result", "id": "req-uuid", "status": "error", "error": "message" }
```

**Message from volunteer → coordinator (GPU status):**
```json
{"type": "gpu_status", "utilization_percent": 12, "memory_used_percent": 45}
```

**Message from volunteer → coordinator (model state):**
```json
{"type": "model_state", "state": "loading"}
{"type": "model_state", "state": "ready", "load_duration_seconds": 42.5, "max_parallel": 4}
{"type": "model_state", "state": "busy"}
{"type": "model_state", "state": "unloading"}
{"type": "model_state", "state": "unloaded"}
```

The volunteer also sends periodic heartbeat pings over the WebSocket.

### OCR → Coordinator (OpenAI-compatible)

Full OpenAI Chat Completions API: `POST /v1/chat/completions`

```
Request:  {model, messages, max_tokens, temperature, stream: false}
Response: {id, object, created, model, choices: [{index, message: {role, content}, finish_reason}]}
Auth:     Authorization: Bearer <token> (optional, configurable)
```

### Volunteer → Coordinator (WebSocket registration)

| Mechanism | Timing | Payload |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **WebSocket `init` message** | On connect (first message) | `{"type": "init", "gpu_info": "...", "model": "..."}` |
| **WebSocket `heartbeat` message** | Every 30s | `{"type": "heartbeat"}` |
| **WebSocket `gpu_status` message** | Every 5s | `{"type": "gpu_status", "utilization_percent": 12, "memory_used_percent": 45}` |
| **WebSocket `model_state` message** | On state change | `{"type": "model_state", "state": "ready", "load_duration_seconds": 42.5}` |

All happen over the **same persistent WebSocket** connection — no separate HTTP endpoints needed.

## Key Design Decisions

### Why llama.cpp instead of LM Studio?

LM Studio has no official Docker image and `lm-link` is designed for peer-to-peer setups with no single API endpoint. `llama.cpp` provides official `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda` Docker images, exposes a correct OpenAI-compatible API, and is MIT-licensed.

### Why 32K context by default?

Code reviews need to see entire files. The Qwen3-30B-A3B model comfortably handles 32K context, and `llama-server` with prompt caching makes repeated context windows efficient. Users can lower to 8K on constrained hardware via the `LLAMA_CTX_SIZE` env var.

### Why auto-download models?

Volunteers shouldn't need to hunt for model files. The entrypoint downloads from Hugging Face with clear progress output so users always know what's happening.

### Why GPU_DEVICES=0 as default?

Most volunteers have a single GPU. Auto-detect the first one. `GPU_DEVICES=none` falls back to CPU. `GPU_DEVICES=all` uses every available GPU. `GPU_DEVICES=0,1` selects specific devices.

### Why automatic GPU utilization monitoring?

Volunteers are often gamers. We don't want to grab their GPU while they're using it, and we don't want them to have to think about toggling anything. The container monitors its own GPU and quietly steps aside when busy.

## Security Model

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Volunteer host access | Only `--gpus` and model volume mount; no `--privileged`, no host network |
| Network access | Only outbound WebSocket + HTTP to coordinator URL |
| Volunteer behind NAT | Works natively — volunteers initiate and maintain the WebSocket connection |
| Authentication | Coordinator validates volunteer identity during WebSocket handshake via `VOLUNTEER_SECRET` |
| PR data leakage | All traffic over HTTPS/TLS recommended for production coordinator |
| Rogue volunteer joining | Coordinator validates `VOLUNTEER_SECRET` on WebSocket connect |
